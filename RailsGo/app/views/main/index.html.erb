		<li>Poor ergonomics can cause musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)</li>

		<p class="align-items-left">MSDs are painful conditions affecting muscles, tendons, tendon sheaths, 
		and nerves. One of the most common is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
		CTS is typically caused by bad ergonomics in the keyboard or mouse, or 
		can be caused by bad posture in regards to said devices.</p>
		<li>Poor ergonomics can cause headaches & migraines</li>
		<p class="align-items-left">When thinking of bad ergonomics, most only think of posture, positioning, the physical state our body is in.
		Ergonomics also includes eyes and light levels, and having poor lighting when on a computer can lead to eye-strain,
		which can cause the headaches and migraines mentioned above. </p>
		<li>Poor ergonomics can cause <q>trigger finger</q></li>
		<p class="align-items-left">When griping a mouse, or controller, your hands can quickly get sore.
If this initial warning from your body isn't heeded, the consequences can be "trigger finger".
This can also be caused by constant repetitive motions of the fingers.
Becoming afflicted with "trigger finger" will leave one feeling sharp pains whenever they try to move their fingers.</p>
		<li>Poor ergonomics can cause back injuries</li>
		<p class="align-items-left">When griping a mouse, or controller, your hands can quickly get sore.

Becoming afflicted with "trigger finger" will leave one feeling sharp pains whenever they try to move their fingers. </p>
		<li>Poor ergonomics can cause a stiff neck</li>
		<p class="align-items-left">This has similar causes as the issue above, and can have similar consequences, the obvious difference being the location of the pain. </p>
		<li>Poor ergonomics can cause you to be easily fatigued</li>
		<p class="align-items-left">Sitting in one place for hours on end can be bad for you, though there's no true consensus on how often you should stand up to take a break from sitting down,
it is agreed upon that you should stand up every once in a while to prevent fatige and slouching. </p>
		<li>Poor ergonomics can cause weight gain</li>
		<p class="align-items-left">This one seems obvious when pointed out, but still deserves mentioning.
Standing burns more calories than sitting. It's a simple fact that makes plenty of sense. </p>
		<li>Poor ergonomics can cause ganglion cysts</li>
		<p class="align-items-left">Ganglion cysts are pea sized, or larger, bumps that form on joints, typically the back of the wrist or fingers.
Though they can come and go, while they're there, they can cause discomfort or even pain. </p>
